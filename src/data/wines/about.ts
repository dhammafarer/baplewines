They have a unique microclimate which combines the dry continental climate (350 litres of rainfall per year) with the Mediterranean climate. This, in addition to the areas clay soil, causes the vigour of the vine-stock to diminish. The extreme temperature difference between night and day promotes slow ripening and the perfect formation of the grapes’ red colour, as well as the genuine aroma of the variety. The whole ecosystem in our area is ideal for producing high quality grapes and intense flavoured wines.",
